## Quick Start with Compose 
1. Grab project
```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web
cd epics2web
```
2. Launch Docker
```
docker compose up
```
3. Monitor test PV via web browser   

http://localhost:8080/epics2web/test-camonitor

PV name: `HELLO`

**See**: [Docker Compose Strategy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/a7da801e8259f5974c978f9c3091d52c)

## Install
   1. Download [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
   1. Download [epics2web.war](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web/releases) and drop it into the Tomcat webapps directory
   1. Start Tomcat and navigate your web browser to localhost:8080/epics2web

**Note:** epics2web also works and was tested with GlassFish, and presumably works with WildFly or any other Java web application server that supports Web Sockets.

**Note:** The dependency jars are included in the _war_ file that is generated by the build.  You can copy the [jar files](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web/tree/master/lib) from project lib directory to the Tomcat lib directory and change the build.gradle script to use _providedCompile_ instead of _implementation_ if you'd prefer to include the dependencies that way.

## API

[API Reference](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web/wiki/API-Reference)

## Configure

This application uses the [Java Channel Access](https://github.com/epics-base/jca) library.   It requires a working EPICS channel access environment with the environment variable *EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST* set.  See Also: [Advanced Configuration](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web/wiki/Advanced-Configuration).

## Build
This project is built with [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/) (compiled to Java 8 bytecode), and uses the [Gradle 7](https://gradle.org/) build tool to automatically download dependencies and build the project from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/epics2web
cd epics2web
gradlew build
```
**Note**: If you do not already have Gradle installed, it will be installed automatically by the wrapper script included in the source

**Note for JLab On-Site Users**: Jefferson Lab has an intercepting [proxy](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/92c25a033db93a90184a5994e71d0b78)

**See**: [Docker Development Quick Reference](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/a7da801e8259f5974c978f9c3091d52c#development-quick-reference)
